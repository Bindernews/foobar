# Google Foobar Challenge
I received Google's Foobar challenge after searching for "C++ move semantics". This was strange to me, given that I've searched MANY
other programming things over the years, and lots of things that are vastly more complex than C++ move semantics, but Google's
algorithms are basically magic. Just for fun I accepted the challenge, and started.

This repository is a record of my solutions and, more importantly, the test cases I used. Most of the challenges have multiple
test cases but show you only a handful of them. Once I realized that I started to try to make my tests as full-proof as possible.
If you can pass my test cases, you should be able to pass the foobar challenge. If you want to solve the challenges your self
but can't figure out why your solution is failing, look at `tests.py`. If you want to see my (often poorly-written) code,
then check out `solution.py`.

In some instances I had to completely re-think my approach and I've kept around my previous attempts for educational purposes.
That code is still in there, which is why the solution functions may be numbered. This repository is both a reference guide
and a log of my though process while trying to solve these.

## Level 1
I started, predictably, at Level 1, and I've already forgotten what the challenge was. It was trivially simple, and took me less
than 20 minutes. I quickly moved on to Level 2.

## Level 2
Level 2 required that I solve 2 problems instead of one, and they were more difficult than Level 1, well sorta.

* Gearing up for Destruction
* Elevator Maintenance

## Level 3
Level 3 is where I started to actually copy the problem descriptions, and you'll see most of the contents of `readme.txt`
replicated for your convenience, although I am leaving off the duplicate test cases to keep things clear. It's also
at this level that I started building a more comprehensive test function.

* Fuel Injection
* Preparing the Bunnies' Escape
* Doomsday Fuel
